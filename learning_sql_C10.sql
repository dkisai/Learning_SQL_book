/*EXERCISE 10-1
Using the following table definitions and data, write a query that returns each customer
name along with their total payments:
Customer:
Customer_id Name
----------- ---------------
1 John Smith
2 Kathy Jones
3 Greg Oliver
Payment:
Payment_id Customer_id Amount
---------- ----------- --------
101 1 8.99
102 3 4.99
103 1 7.99
Include all customers, even if no payment records exist for that customer.*/


/*EXERCISE 10-2
Reformulate your query from Exercise 10-1 to use the other outer join type (e.g., if
you used a left outer join in Exercise 10-1, use a right outer join this time) such that
the results are identical to Exercise 10-1.*/


/*EXERCISE 10-3 (Extra Credit)
Devise a query that will generate the set {1, 2, 3, ..., 99, 100}. (Hint: use a cross join
with at least two from clause subqueries.)*/
